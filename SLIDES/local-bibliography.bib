  abstract = {Background The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. Methods We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. Results We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. Conclusion Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20\% of the population.},

  abstract = {Stochastic simulations of network models have become the standard approach to studying epidemics. We show that many of the predictions of these models can also be obtained from simple classical deterministic compartmental models. We suggest that simple models may be a better way to plan for a threatening pandemic with location and parameters as yet unknown, reserving more detailed network models for disease outbreaks already underway in localities where the social networks are well identified. We formulate compartmental models to describe outbreaks of influenza and attempt to manage a disease outbreak by vaccination or antiviral treatment. The models give an important prediction that may not have been noticed in other models, namely that the number of doses of antiviral treatment required is extremely sensitive to the number of initial infectives. This suggests that the actual number of doses needed cannot be estimated with any degree of reliability. The model is applicable to pre-epidemic vaccination, such as annual vaccination programs in anticipation of an "ordinary" influenza outbreak with limited drift, and as a combination of treatment both before and during an epidemic.},

For some parameter values, the model is shown to exhibit a backward bifurcation, leading to the existence of subthreshold endemic equilibria. Numerical examples are presented that demonstrate the consequence of this bifurcation in terms of epidemic control. The model can alternatively be interpreted as one consisting of two social groups, with education playing the role of vaccination.},

Because of the difference in population sizes, the urban centre has standard incidence and satellite cities have mass action incidence. It is shown that the general basic reproduction number $\R_0$ acts as a threshold between global asymptotic stability of the disease free equilibrium and disease persistence. The case of Winnipeg (Manitoba, Canada) and some neighbouring satellite communities is then considered numerically to complement the mathematical analysis, highlighting the importance of taking into account not only $\R_0$ but also other measures of disease severity. It is found that the large urban centre governs most of the behaviour of the general system and control of the spread is better achieved by targeting it rather than reducing movement between the units. Also, the capacity of a satellite city to affect the general system depends on its population size and its connectivity to the main urban centre.},

If travel is assumed to be independent of disease status, then numerical results are cited that indicate that for $R_0 > 1$ solutions tend to an endemic equilibrium with the disease present in each patch. The system is extended to include cross infection between several species. A second extension involves keeping track of both the current patch and the patch in which an individual usually resides. Travel can change disease spread in a complicated way; it may help the disease to persist or may aid disease extinction. Complexity that can be built into metapopulation models is illustrated by three case-study examples from the literature.},

  abstract = {Dynamic models of many processes in the biological and physical sciences which depend on local mass balance conditions give rise to systems of ordinary differential equations, many nonlinear, that are called compartmental systems. In this paper, the authors define compartmental systems, specify their relations to other nonnegative systems, and discuss examples of applications.The authors review the qualitative results on linear and nonlinear compartmental systems, including their relation to cooperative systems. They review the results for linear compartmental systems and then integrate and expand the results on nonlinear compartmental systems, providing a framework for unifying them under a few general theorems. In the course of that they complete the solution of a problem posed by Bellman and show that closed nonlinear, autonomous, n-compartment systems can show the full gamut of possible behaviors of systems of ODES.Finally, to provide additional structure to this study, the authors show how to partiti...},

  abstract = {A general SIS epidemic model is formulated that incorporates media-induced modification of travel rates. Basic local properties of solutions to the model are established. In particular, it is shown that the basic reproduction number does not involve parameters related to the effect of media on travel. The general model is subsequently specialised to two-patch models, with two different scenarios regarding patch population size. Qualitative analyses show that the basic reproduction number acts as a sharp threshold between disease persistence and extinction. The concept of uniform weak persistence is used to prove the existence of an endemic equilibrium and disease uniform strong persistence under a certain condition. Numerical investigations are carried out to gain insight into the analytically tractable and intractable cases, highlighting the importance of considering not only the basic reproduction number but also other measures of disease severity.},
